Q.What do the .data, .word, .text directives mean (i.e. what do you use them for)? Hint: think about the 4 sections of memory.

.data contains the variables for the assembly. Inside it we have .word sections that represent 8 byte variables in memory

Q.Run the program to completion. What number did the program output? What does this number represent?

34, 9th fibonacci number

Q.At what address is n stored in memory? Hint: Look at the contents of the registers.

0x10000010

Q.Without using the "Edit" tab, have the program calculate the 13th fib number (0-indexed) by manually modifying the value of a register. You may find it helpful to first step through the code. If you prefer to look at decimal values, change the "Display Settings" option at the bottom.

Change x28 after 5th instruction

Task: Find/explain the following components of this assembly file.

The register representing the variable k. - t0

The registers acting as pointers to the source and dest arrays. - t2,t1

The assembly code for the loop found in the C code. - L28-35

How the pointers are manipulated in the assembly code. - L28,32

Q. Find the section of code in lab3_ex2.s that corresponds to the copying loop and explain how each line is used in manipulating the pointer.

loop:
    slli t3, t0, 2 # t3=4*t0
    add t4, t1, t3 # t4 = A+t0*4
    lw t5, 0(t4) # t5 = [t4]
    beq t5, x0, exit # quit if t5 == 0
    add t6, t2, t3 # t6 = B+t0*4
    sw t5, 0(t6) # [t6] = t5
    addi t0, t0, 1 # t0++
    jal x0, loop  # restart loop

Q3. Factorial done using loop
