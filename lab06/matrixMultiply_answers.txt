Which ordering(s) perform best for these 1000-by-1000 matrices? Why?
jki and kji. The innermost loops accesses data sequentially exploting temporal locality. 

Which ordering(s) perform the worst? Why?
The worst performers are ijk, ikj, jik and kij. All perform about the same as bad because the innermost loop is nop able to exploit temporal locality


How does the way we stride through the matrices with respect to the innermost loop affect performance?
If the innermost loop has a stride of 1 then the performance is fast otherwise with stride n its bad. innermost loop has the strongest effect.
